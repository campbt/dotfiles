iTerm2:

    + Note: The keybinding Send Hex Code: "0x02 0x1b 0x5f" will send Ctrl _ (which is what vim and fish are looking for to leave insert mode)

Package Manager:
    + Go download brew: https://brew.sh/

Fonts:
    + Droid Sans Mono Slashed
        https://github.com/AlbertoDorado/droid-sans-mono-zeromod
